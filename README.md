 Parametric Study of Different Shaped Planar Antennas with DGS for Handheld Wireless  Communication.

 📡 Compact Planar Antenna Designs for Handheld Wireless Applications

Antenna Design, Simulation & Parametric Analysis using CST Microwave Studio

📘 Overview

This project presents the design, simulation, and optimization of various compact planar antennas intended for handheld wireless communication devices. All antennas were modeled and analyzed using CST Microwave Studio Suite, employing Rogers RT5880 (lossy) substrate for efficient high-frequency performance.

Since small antennas typically suffer from narrow bandwidth and low gain, this work introduces Defected Ground Structures (DGS) to enhance bandwidth, gain, and overall radiation characteristics. Each antenna geometry was chosen to ensure optimal current distribution and omnidirectional radiation patterns.
